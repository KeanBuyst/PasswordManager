# Password Manager

Matric IT PAT

Connects with browser extension for "seemless" password retrival in browser.
Program isn't ideal as per the limitations given by the IEB (or school rather). Since marks were awarded on classes, methods, inheritance rather than functionality.

I achieved a **97%** for this project.

## Build

* Requires NetBeans IDE 20
* Java 17+

## Improvements

* Password Manager launch on start up of pc
* Less UI *(required by PAT)*
* rewrite of much of the code *(marks were lost if code of final phase in PAT mis-matched with second phase outline of code structure. Thus changes in structure which would have potentially made the code more readble and less bug prone couldn't be implemented)*
